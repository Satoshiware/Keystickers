# Using a Raspberry Pi 3b 
#   Raspbian OS with desktop
#     Release date: February 21st 2023
#     System: 32-bit
#     Kernel version: 5.15
#     Debian version: 11 (bullseye)
# Printer: HP LaserJet M402n (wireless connectivity physically removed).

sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

sudo apt-get -y install default-jdk

# Disable wireless connectivity
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
# Add the following two lines after the line that says "Additional overlays and parameters are documented /boot/overlays/README"
#       dtoverlay=disable-wifi
#       dtoverlay=disable-bt

# With the printer plugged in and powered
sudo apt-get -y install cups
sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin $ADMINUSER
sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart

# Printer settings accessed via browser: http://localhost:631
# May need to add printer manually: 
#	  http://localhost:631 -> Administration -> Add Printer -> Login $ADMINUSER/$ADMINPASSWD

# It's allready to go!
# Restart the pi and make sure everything is disconnected from the internet.
# Then, go make some Keystickers!

# Notes: java.awt.print dialog is not printing, but it will output a postscript (.ps) file.
#   Just select "Print To File" in the print dialog when it appears and then click "Print".
#   After the postscript file is created/saved, open the .ps file in the Raspbian's default application;
#   it will have the printing capabilities to correctly and successfully print from there.
 
# With the output file saved, make sure it is securely deleted!!!!!
shred -uvz -n 6 $FILENAME # This will Shred 6 times
